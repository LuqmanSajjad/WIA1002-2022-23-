Answer: all of the above

Finding factorial: One way to find the factorial of a number is to use a stack to keep track of the intermediate results. As each intermediate result is computed, it is pushed onto the stack, and when the final result is computed, it is popped from the stack.

Tower of Hanoi: The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem that can be solved using a stack. In this problem, a set of disks of different sizes are stacked on one of three pegs. The goal is to move the entire stack to another peg, subject to certain rules. A stack can be used to keep track of the intermediate steps involved in the solution.

Infix to postfix: Converting an infix expression to postfix (or prefix) is another problem that can be solved using a stack. In this problem, a stack is used to keep track of operators and parentheses as they are encountered in the input expression. The final postfix expression is constructed by popping operators from the stack in the correct order.
