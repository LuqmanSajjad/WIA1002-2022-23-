Recursion is hard

here's are what I learn through out :: 

One of the ways to frame your recurison, you wirte these cont eqn
it might helps to write the return statement before the base function 

    return a + function(bcd) + function(cd) + .. 

sometimes if you can visualise the output table, you can find underlying patterns that yuo can cheat through::
 * pascal triangle, s


you can assume recursion as a normal if else structure
