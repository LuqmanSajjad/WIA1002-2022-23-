# TUTORIAL BST 

## 1. What is a binary search tree (BST)?
binary search tree is a node data structure, 
represented in a tree graph, with the left subtree of a node only contains smaller nodes 
and the right subtree constains the bigger nodes.

## 2. Build a BST based on the input 50, 30, 25, 71, 80, 99, 40, 1, 7, 5. Draw the final tree.

## 3. What is the height of the tree built in Question 2?
5 

## 4. Given the following BST, list the items in the order of:
a. preorder transversal - +12
    - 0100, 0050, 0025, 0001, 0030, 0070, 0065, 0085, 0150, 0135, 0169, 0180

b. postorder transversal - 12+
    - 0001, 0030, 0025, 0065, 0085, 0070, 0050, 0135, 0180, 0169, 0150, 0100

c. inorder transversal - 1+2
    - 0001, 0025, 0030, 0050, 0065, 0070, 0085, 0100, 0135, 0150, 0169, 0180

## 5. Using the same BST in Question 4, delete the element `0030’. Draw the resulting tree.


## 6. Again, using the same BST in Question 3 (i.e., ignoring the deletion of `0030’ in Question 5), delete the element `0050’. Draw the resulting tree.
