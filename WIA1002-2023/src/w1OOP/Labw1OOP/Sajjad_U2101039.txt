My name is Sajjad with matrix number, U2101039. I am
majoring in Computer System and Network. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this
subject. This is because instead of avoiding our fears, a man should embrace it like a petal in the Moon.
I acquired B+ for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will finish studying all the teaching content of the week
before stepping into the lecture hall. Wish me luck!!!
