# Tutorial Searching Sorting week 12
## 1. Compare between linear search and binary search algorithms by searching for the numbers 45 and 54 in the following list :
**3 8 12 34 54 85 61 110**

- Linear search serach the element by iterating all the element in an array one by one
- binary search requires sorting first of all 

## 2. Describe the technique for each sort algorithm below. Given the following list:
**90 8 7 56 125 237 9 1 653**

Show a trace of execution for:

a. Selection sort (complexity n log n)
``` 
// compare the current element with the remaining
iterate forward
    find the minimum one from the remaining elements 
    if found, swap
```

b. Insertion sort
```
// compare the current element with the previous sorted
iterate forward 
    compare the current with the previous, 
    offset the previous sorted to the desired index
    place the element
```
c. Bubble sort
```
```

d. Merge sort
```
```
