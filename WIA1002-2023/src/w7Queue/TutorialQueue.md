# Tutorial Queue Week 7

1. Name four everyday examples of a queue other than those discussed during lecture.
```

```

2. What is the difference between a queue and stack?
```
- Queue first in first out, Stack first in last out
- 
```

3. Use the following code segment to answer parts (a) through (c):
```
Queue<Integer> q = new Queue<Integer>();
Scanner keyIn = new Scanner(System.in);
for (int i = 1;i <= 5; i++)
{
    if (keyIn.nextBoolean())
    System.out.print(i + " ");
    else
    q.enqueue(i);
}
}
while (!q.isEmpty())
    System.out.print(q.dequeue() + " ");

System.out.println();
```

(a) What is the output for the following input sequence?

```true false false true true```


(b) Is it possible to have output: 1 3 5 4 2? If yes, give an input sequence that produces the
output; or else, provide justification to your answer.
(c) Give at least three input sequences that produce the output: 1 2 3 4 5
4. Hand trace a queue X through the following operations:
 X.enqueue(new Integer(14));
 X.enqueue(new Integer(3));
 X.enqueue(new Integer(5));
 Object Y = X.dequeue();
 X.enqueue(new Integer(7));
 X.enqueue(new Integer(9));
 Y = X.dequeue();
 X.enqueue(new Integer(2));
 X.enqueue(new Integer(4));
Given the resulting queue X above, what would be the result of each of the following?
WIA1002/WIB1002 FCSIT, UM
UO Page 2
a) X.front();
b) Y = X.dequeue();
X.enqueue(new Integer(10));
X.front();
c) Y = X.dequeue();
d) X.front();
5. Provide and explain three operations / functions of Linked List based Queue that you can add
to the GenericQueue class, other than those discussed in the lecture (i.e., enqueue, dequeue
and getSize – from Slide 10 in the lecture slide).
