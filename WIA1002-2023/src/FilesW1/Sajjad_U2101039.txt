My name is Sajjad with matrix number, U2101039. I am
majoring in Computer System and Network. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited ( ಠ ͜ʖ ಠ ) about taking this
subject. This is because instead of avoiding our fears, a man should embrace it like a petal in the Moon.
I acquired B+ for my previous Programming 1 course. It’s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will finish studying all the teaching content of the week
before stepping into the lecture hall. Wish me luck!!!

I have done my best. People said this course is hard, and yeah no doubt about that.
I learned a lot more about new advance programming concepts that I have never 
met before since my 2 years experience learning to code. It is indeed a very though one
but taught me the most. Well I got an A-. A really tough fight lol. I think if i am given more
time I would definitely could get slightly higher grade. I think what I did great during this
course is that I pre-studied the topics before coming to lecture hall. I am well prepared
and equipped for the lecture and is able to come up with relevant questions that indicates
my awareness level about the discussion, unlike the past semester. I think what I could have
done better is more practice with outside resources such as Leetcode and CodeForce.
I dont want to continue to babble more nonsense because this will age so well like wine.
So I think that's it.
